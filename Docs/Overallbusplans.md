CITIZENS: From Entrepreneur to Relational Change-Maker
Executive Summary
The Citizens program within IMAGI-NATION addresses a fundamental misalignment in how we conceptualize change-making in modern society. Moving beyond the limited "heroic entrepreneur" model, Citizens creates pathways for 1,000 systems change leaders to develop collaborative, relational approaches to societal transformation. This business case outlines the opportunity, methodology, and potential impact of the Citizens initiative.
The Challenge
Our current models of social impact and entrepreneurship face critical limitations:
The entrepreneur obsession places disproportionate emphasis on individual heroic journeys
Change-makers experience isolation and loneliness in their work

The Citizens program isn't simply about creating better individual change-makers; it's about restructuring how change happens through relational networks that can address complex challenges no individual could solve alone. For those ready to transcend the limitations of heroic entrepreneurship, the Citizens pathway offers both the framework and community to create meaningful, lasting change.

"They acknowledge they've lived the facade... they really want to actually create the change that lasts, that's all they're interested in. They want to put their energy in the most effective space, and they acknowledge that to do that they have to connect with people they don't know and with things they don't know. But that's the only way they're gonna find that pass." - Jack Manning Bancroft

Case Study: Heliogenesis
One example of a Systems Change Residency project already in development is Heliogenesis, which Jack Manning Bancroft describes:
"Thomas's theory of change or premise is that... we don't know how to [capture the sun's energy effectively] but plants do, and they do that with photosynthesis every single day, so he wants to look at how by tapping into the plant network that can power life on Earth, that the plant becomes a conductor to move the energy from the sun through. And, you know, he solves that, then maybe that's our energy problem solved."
This project exemplifies the ambitious scope of Systems Change Residency projects - addressing fundamental planetary challenges through innovative approaches that bridge natural and technological systems.

Conclusion
The Systems Change Residents program addresses a critical gap between visionary ideas and practical implementation. By supporting 130 ambitious Earth-shot projects with specialized resources for development and communication, the program creates pathways for transformative approaches to gain traction.
As Jack Manning Bancroft articulates about the immersive experience: "They'll get to come and have a connection with an Indigenous knowledge systems holder on land and an on-land lab and bring their problem that they're trying to solve onto the land with some of the longest continuous labs on planet Earth."
The Systems Change Residents initiative isn't simply about supporting individual innovators; it's about creating an ecosystem where ambitious systemic solutions can be developed, communicated, and implemented effectively. For visionaries committed to addressing our most significant planetary challenges, the Systems Change Residents pathway offers both the framework and community to translate bold ideas into practical action.

"Those 130 will experience a system change physical residency in Australia and then we'll support them with the creation of tools to help communicate this complexity of big ideas so it can get back into the existing system and move the capital and behavior and create the movement that they need around them." - Jack Manning Bancroft
TOOLSHED: Creating Legacy Resources for Relational Change
Executive Summary
The Toolshed represents IMAGI-NATION's commitment to creating 150 enduring resourcesâ€”including books, films, methodologies, and protocolsâ€”that will outlast the organization's intentional 10-year lifespan. This business case outlines how the Toolshed will develop and distribute these tools to enable continued application of relational approaches to systemic challenges long after IMAGI-NATION itself has concluded.
The Challenge
Knowledge transfer for systemic change faces significant barriers:
Valuable methodologies often remain tacit rather than explicit
Solutions stay within organizational boundaries rather than being widely shared
Heroic narrative structures hide the "how-to" details of successful approaches
Complex systems knowledge is rarely translated into accessible formats
Organizational death limits legacy knowledge transfer
Future generations lack access to proven approaches for relational change
As Jack Manning Bancroft observes: "We need to codify how do we collaborate with each other again, how do we have discourse, how do we have debate, how do we have conflict, how do we understand how to misunderstand and how do we create a level of complexity into our discourse."
The Opportunity
The Toolshed initiative offers:
Legacy Creation: Developing resources that ensure knowledge continues beyond IMAGI-NATION's 10-year lifespan.


Methodology Codification: Making tacit knowledge explicit through structured documentation.

By creating 150 tools that document and share methodologies for relational approaches to systemic challenges, the initiative ensures that valuable knowledge continues to create impact for generations.
As Jack Manning Bancroft articulates: "We're intentionally, by facing our death as a network, we're intentionally understanding that the tools are the things that shape everything into the future, and if we can leave behind these tools, that will be our greatest legacy."
The Toolshed isn't simply about documenting what IMAGI-NATION has done; it's about creating resources that enable others to apply, adapt, and evolve these approaches to meet future challenges. For a world facing increasingly complex systemic problems, these tools provide practical pathways toward more relational, collaborative, and effective solutions.

"We don't want to be the only group that you ever learn from... each body of work is contributing to a collective set of tools... we're unashamedly borrowing from [Wikipedia] in creating co-created books for everybody to then leave that behind." - Jack Manning Bancroft
CUSTODIANS: Governing the Relational Network
Executive Summary
The Custodians program establishes a distributed governance system for IMAGI-NATION, engaging 150 individuals annually to take responsibility for specific aspects of the network. This business case outlines how these Custodians will ensure the health, integrity, and effectiveness of IMAGI-NATION through shared leadership based on both scientific research (Dunbar's number) and indigenous kinship systems.
The Challenge
Traditional governance approaches face significant limitations in relational network contexts:
Centralized leadership creates bottlenecks and single points of failure
Small teams cannot effectively govern large, complex networks
Conventional corporate structures reinforce hero narratives and individualism
Accountability becomes diffused without specific responsibility assignments
Cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary networks require diverse governance perspectives
Digital platforms often lack meaningful human accountability
As Jack Manning Bancroft observes: "35 of us, even if we're extraordinary inside of AIM, cannot govern this thing alone."
The Opportunity
The Custodians program offers:
Distributed Responsibility: Creating a governance system where 150 individuals take specific ownership for network health.


Relational Leadership: Building governance based on relationship quality rather than hierarchical authority.


Collective Accountability: Establishing shared responsibility for both successes and failures.


Knowledge Diversity: Ensuring governance includes perspectives from various disciplines and cultures.


Legacy Continuity: Creating an intergenerational governance model that can persist beyond individual leadership.


Theoretical Foundation
The Custodians program is built on two complementary frameworks:
Dunbar's Number
Robin Dunbar's anthropological research indicates that 150 represents a cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. IMAGI-NATION's governance model embraces this natural limit by establishing 150 Custodians annually.
Indigenous Kinship Systems
Traditional Indigenous governance approaches emphasize relationship networks and distributed responsibility. The Custodians model integrates these approaches to create culturally-appropriate governance structures.
As Jack Manning Bancroft explains: "We've looked at Robin Dunbar and how to how many relations we can actually hold of value and then we've mapped that with indigenous kinship models as well."
The Custodian Role
Custodians hold several key responsibilities:
Network Segment Stewardship: Taking responsibility for a specific aspect of IMAGI-NATION.


Cultural Integrity Maintenance: Ensuring activities align with core values and principles.


Relational Health Monitoring: Attending to the quality of connections within their domain.


Problem Resolution: Stepping forward when challenges arise rather than diffusing responsibility.


Knowledge Transfer: Ensuring wisdom is passed on to future Custodians.


Selection and Recognition
The Custodians process involves:
Selection Criteria
Demonstrated commitment to relational principles
Completion of preparatory IMAGI-NATION experiences
Capacity for responsible leadership
Relationship quality within their network segment
Diversity across knowledge systems and contexts
Recognition Mechanism
Custodians receive a physical "Custodian Hoodie" that serves as both recognition and responsibility marker. As Jack Manning Bancroft describes it: "These hoodies will be relationally made, relationally credited and relationally gifted so that energy can carry on."
Implementation Approach
The Custodians program follows key phases:
Preparation (Varies by pathway)


Completion of relevant IMAGI-NATION journeys
Relationship building within network
Understanding of governance principles
Selection (Annual)


Identification of potential Custodians
Peer recommendation process
Commitment confirmation
Responsibility Assignment (Annual)


Allocation of specific network aspects
Clarification of expectations
Connection with predecessor Custodians
Active Custodianship (1 year)


Regular network health check-ins
Participation in collective governance
Problem resolution as needed
Legacy Transfer (Final months)


Knowledge documentation
Successor identification
Relationship handover
Value Creation
The Custodians program creates value through:
Network Integrity
Maintaining cultural and operational alignment
Ensuring consistent quality across diverse activities
Preventing mission drift and value dilution
Distributed Intelligence
Leveraging diverse perspectives in governance
Creating multiple sensing points throughout the network
Enabling contextual decision-making
Relationship Quality
Focusing governance on connection health
Building trust through personal accountability
Creating intergenerational continuity
Operational Effectiveness
Preventing governance bottlenecks
Enabling rapid response to emerging issues
Creating clear responsibility lines
Case Study: Governance in Action
One example of Custodian governance in practice:
When a conflict emerges between different IMAGI-NATION participants, rather than escalating to a centralized authority, the relevant Custodians would come together to:
Acknowledge shared responsibility
Facilitate appropriate dialogue
Support relationship repair
Document learning for future prevention
Ensure appropriate follow-through
This approach maintains relational integrity while addressing problems effectively, demonstrating the practical application of distributed governance.
Measurement Framework
Custodian effectiveness will be tracked through:
Relationship Health Metrics: Assessing connection quality within their domain
Problem Resolution Indicators: Measuring how effectively issues are addressed
Knowledge Transfer Assessment: Evaluating continuity between Custodian generations
Network Alignment Evaluation: Assessing consistency with IMAGI-NATION principles
Collective Responsibility Measures: Tracking shared accountability in action
Legacy Planning
The Custodians model is designed for intergenerational continuity through:
Documentation: Each Custodian cohort captures learnings for future generations
Physical Symbols: Custodian hoodies can be passed on to family members
Relationship Networks: Custodians maintain connections beyond their active term
Directory Access: Custodians retain lifetime access to the network directory
Knowledge Exchange: Regular gatherings of current and former Custodians
Conclusion
The Custodians program represents a fundamental reimagining of governance for relational networks. By establishing 150 individuals with specific responsibility for network health, IMAGI-NATION creates a system that balances accountability with distribution, authority with relationship, and current leadership with intergenerational continuity.
As Jack Manning Bancroft articulates: "When something goes wrong, I'll definitely put my hand up, but I'm hoping there'll be 149 people alongside me that'll say, yeah, I was also responsible for that and we missed that. So you'll be able to see a proper coalition of shared leadership and responsibility, not just your traditional kind of CEO hiding away in some office somewhere."
The Custodians model isn't simply about managing a network; it's about creating a living example of how governance can function through relationship rather than hierarchy. For those committed to reimagining leadership beyond conventional corporate models, the Custodians pathway offers both a framework and community to develop new approaches to responsible stewardship.

"So it won't necessarily, when something goes wrong, I'll definitely put my hand up, but I'm hoping there'll be 149 people alongside me that'll say, yeah, I was also responsible for that and we missed that. So you'll be able to see a proper coalition of shared leadership and responsibility." - Jack Manning Bancroft
