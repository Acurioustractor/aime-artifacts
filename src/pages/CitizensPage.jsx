      <Section title="Executive Summary">
        <p>The Citizens program within IMAGI-NATION addresses a fundamental misalignment in how we conceptualize change-making in modern society. Moving beyond the limited "heroic entrepreneur" model, Citizens creates pathways for 1,000 systems change leaders to develop collaborative, relational approaches to societal transformation. This business case outlines the opportunity, methodology, and potential impact of the Citizens initiative.</p>

      <Section title="The Challenge">
        <p>Our current models of social impact and entrepreneurship face critical limitations:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li>The entrepreneur obsession places disproportionate emphasis on individual heroic journeys</li>
          <li>Change-makers experience isolation and loneliness in their work</li>
          <li>Leaders struggle to admit what they don't know or acknowledge they aren't the most intelligent person in the room</li>
          <li>Many change agents have limited collaborative capabilities despite possessing individual talents</li>
          <li>The pursuit of recognition and awards often supersedes genuine impact</li>
          <li>Credit-seeking behavior undermines sustainable change potential</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-200 pl-4 italic text-gray-500 mt-2">
          "This idea that the entrepreneur, the individual hero's journey... has succeeded in lots of different ways. And got all the feedback loops, and has been lonely in that journey... and actually understanding that this is a facade." - Jack Manning Bancroft

          "If they can invest in the node in the network, and how they relate to other people, they can invest in their ability to translate â€“ that their superpower will be multiplied by forces of like a hundred to a thousand to a million, if they can just spend their time really listening deeply to people and to other creatures." - Jack Manning Bancroft
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Citizens program isn't simply about creating better individual change-makers; it's about restructuring how change happens through relational networks that can address complex challenges no individual could solve alone. For those ready to transcend the limitations of heroic entrepreneurship, the Citizens pathway offers both the framework and community to create meaningful, lasting change.</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-200 pl-4 italic text-gray-500 mt-2">
          "They acknowledge they've lived the facade... they really want to actually create the change that lasts, that's all they're interested in. They want to put their energy in the most effective space, and they acknowledge that to do that they have to connect with people they don't know and with things they don't know. But that's the only way they're gonna find that pass." - Jack Manning Bancroft
